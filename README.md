# A React Component Tree Visualizer

This project aims to create a higher representation of programming by analyzing and visualizing the component structure of a React application. This visualization displays a tree diagram of the React component hierarchy, with each component represented by two attributes: the component's name and its props.

## How it Works

The tool uses static analysis methods to parse React component code. It uses `react-docgen` to extract information about components, including their props. Additionally, it utilizes the `precinct` module to determine the dependencies between components. The tool then builds and displays a hierarchical tree representing the React component structure.

## Usage

This project is currently under development. More detailed usage instructions will be added as the project progresses.
